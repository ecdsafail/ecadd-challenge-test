//! Karatsuba modular square-subtract: `out -= y^2 (mod p)` on secp256k1.
//!
//! Called once per point addition, as the `square` phase, where `y` holds
//! the chord slope and `out` the running x-coordinate. `y` comes back
//! bit-exact and every scratch qubit is returned to |0>, because this runs
//! inside a larger reversible computation that is later run backwards.
//!
//! `y = a + b*2^128` gives `y^2 = A + (C - A - B)*2^128 + B*2^256` with
//! `A = a^2`, `B = b^2`, `C = (a+b)^2`, so three squares suffice rather than
//! four. Each is built by the same split one level down, in `tri_square_k2r`,
//! and folded into `out` with integer weights -- which is what lets each be
//! materialised, folded and uncomputed before the next is built.
//!
//! The sign of every fold is settled while the circuit is built, so it travels
//! as a `bool` and never as a wire: `negate` turns an add into the
//! complement-add-complement subtraction.
